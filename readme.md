# Leia
So this is Leia, it's called Leia because it can be üêí, oh and Leia is from Star Wars and my cat is called Leia.

This is my very first tweak I've created. I want to thank [@Liteeen](https://www.twitter.com/Litteeen) for writing a decentttt tutorial on how to get started with tweak development. Also a lot of my stuff I would not have been able to do without taking a look at [Litten's Rose source code](https://github.com/Litteeen/Rose).

# What does Leia do?
It's a very simple tweak that shows you a cool animated lightsaber on your lockscreen instead of the FaceID icon. You can customize the lightsaber's color, hilt (grip) and position/size to an extend.
