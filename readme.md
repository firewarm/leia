# Leia
So this is Leia, it's called Leia because it can be üêí, oh and because Leia from Star Wars and my cat called Leia.

This is my very first tweak I've created. I want to thank [@liteeen](https://www.twitter.com/Litteeen) for writing a decentttt tutorial on how to get started with tweak development. Also a lot of my stuff I would not have been able to do without taking a look at [Litten's Rose source code](https://github.com/Litteeen/Rose).


# What does Leia do?
It's a very simple tweak that shows you a cool lightsaber on your lockscreen. You can customize it's color and position/size to an extend.
